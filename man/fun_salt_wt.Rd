\title{Ion content in the sample (weight \%)}
\usage{
fun_salt_wt(salt_ppm, dry_g, water_ml)
}
\arguments{
\item{salt_ppm}{Ion concentration in ppm or mg/L}

\item{dry_g}{Dry sample mass in grams}

\item{water_ml}{Volume of water in millilitres}
}
\value{
Numeric value for ion content in the sample expressed as weight percentage (w\%)
}
\description{
Calculate the weight fraction of each individual ion in the sample (w\%),
based on ion concentration (ppm or mg/L), volume of water (mL),
and the dry mass of the sample (g).
}
\details{
Eqn 1. Weight fraction (w_i), as preparation for charge balance equations.

The calculation is:
\deqn{
w_i = \frac{C_{\mathrm{ppm}} \times V_{\mathrm{water}}}{10000 \times m_{\mathrm{dry}}}
}
where:
\itemize{
  \item \eqn{C_{\mathrm{ppm}}}: ion concentration in ppm or mg/L
  \item \eqn{V_{\mathrm{water}}}: volume of water in millilitres
  \item \eqn{m_{\mathrm{dry}}}: dry mass of the sample in grams
}
}
\examples{
# Chloride test data with scalar inputs

# Vectorized usage with salt_test and mol_wts data frames/lists

  salt_test$chloride_ppm,
  salt_test$dry_g,
  salt_test$water_ml
)
