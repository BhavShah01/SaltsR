## Application

[SaltsR Online Application](https://oceanonline.shinyapps.io/SaltsRApp/)

The SaltsR package provides an application to test its calculations. This interactive tool allows you to evaluate the package's output using ion chromatography data.

For details about the calculations and the most up-to-date functions, please use the [Salts Content Calculator](https://predict.kikirpa.be/index.php/tools/moisture-and-salt-sample-data-analysis-tool/).

To launch the application, simply run the following command in R:

``` r
runSaltsR_app()
```

## Salt balance function

Use the function below with the following inputs to perform a salt balance. The full outputs of the function are shown underneath.

Please raise issues with the SaltsR calculations on the [Github issues page](https://github.com/BhavShah01/SaltsR/issues).

``` r
fun_salt_balance(sample_name = "Example",
                 dry_g = 1,
                 water_ml = 100,
                 chloride_ppm = 50,
                 nitrate_ppm = 30,
                 sulfate_ppm = 20,
                 sodium_ppm = 40,
                 potassium_ppm = 10,
                 calcium_ppm = 15,
                 magnesium_ppm = 5)
```
